                The metaphor that resonated with me the most in this reading was a website as a garden, because I feel it beautifully captures the essence of nurturing and cultivating abstract, digital ideas. I think it also relates to the way we are approaching web design in this course. Although starting at a very bare-bone fundamental level, we are still creating abstract ideas digitally. These ideas are like our young plants, similar to the website as a plant metaphor, that we are slowly growing from a seed into a fully grown garden of ideas and knowledge.

                It was interesting to learn about the challenges and opportunities posed by the post-digital era. The issues that arose from copyright, distribution, and the democratization of publishing through self-publishing versus online platforms is an aspect of print I never realized. After reading, I actually asked my parents when they remember switching from newspaper prints to consuming news online. They told me it took them a long time until they accepted online forms of news because they used newspapers as their primary outlet for decades. It's hard to imagine someone regularly reading the paper in today's online culture. What was even more interesting was the idea of hybrid forms of media, which I thought were already part of society. However, when I think about it, the New York Times for example has a plethora of news to consume on their website, which is impossible to condense onto one newspaper everyday. Because of this, I think these types of hybrid forms of news are something I'd like to explore and learn about in greater detail. </div>

                The idea of GeoCities is super cool. I feel like it almost paved the way for other sites and creative techniques on the internet because it offered so much freedom. It is the first way for people to freely and openly engage on the internet, without feeling bound by any rules. The freedom of expression people were allowed back in the 90s is amazing, but nothing our current culture could fully accept. In almost every web building project, there is always some status quo norms that people follow. The process, especially creatively, has been boiled down into placing boxes inside sections, adding text with pre-established type styles, or using artificially pictures. These companies, such as Yahoo!, took an amazing idea and boiled it down into simple steps that anyone can learn. The ability to express yourself without any boundaries is nearly impossible now, without pre-existing experience.

            <div class="reading-week">Reading week 6</div>
            <div class="reading-content">
                Seth Price’s “Dispersion” is a thought-provoking exploration of the impact digital technology has made on art, culture, and society. One of the central tenets of Price’s writing is that art is information, and in the age of digitization the meaning of art has been changed. Price argues that the digital age is unconfined to physical spaces, such as galleries or museums. Art now exists as data, which can be reproduced, copied, and shared across seemingly infinite virtual spaces. This shift in culture creates challenges for traditional notions of art and originality, as digital art has no standard for authenticity. Price also discusses the potential democratization of digital technology in art. He points out that the internet provides a platform for endless ranges of voices and artists to be heard and seen. This challenges the traditional mechanisms of the art world and opens up new possibilities for artistic expression unlike anything the world has witnessed before. In essence, anything can be called art when it is digital.

                I found it really interesting to learn about alt-text in the context of accessibility. In my opinion, it’s an extremely challenging space to approach as a designer because you need to consider the many ways you can describe your imagery. It reminds me of the brilliance a writer possesses when describing a story, making it feel creative and real, especially when the reader uses their imagination. The ways we see things are the ways our minds interpret them, but how can we describe that to someone who doesn't share that sense? How can we share the same experience with them effectively and effortlessly? Bojana Coklyat and Shannon Finnegan offer their discoveries in this specific space and the ways we can implement them into our design storytelling. Although each designer has their own individual taste, we’re all still able to work from each other and showcase the ways we have expressed our understanding of designs and how our audience has perceived them.

                I enjoyed reading “A Personal Computer for Children of All Culture,” as I was recently thinking about equitable programming when my friend studying Computer Science described an engineering essay he wrote about creating programming languages that are inclusive and accessible to a global audience. I never considered how English is the dominant language in the field of technology and how it poses barriers for non-English speakers. While many programming languages are currently designed and documented in English, Nasser designed a non-English programming language for non-English speaking new programmers. The keyword there is “new,” as non-English speaking individuals trying to break into the programming field are at an inherent disadvantage to their fluent speaking peers. Creating equitable programming languages provides comprehensive support for multiple languages and cultures.

            <div class="reading-content">
                Vera Frankel's "String Game" serves as a focal point in our discourse on the intricate interplay between the digital and physical realms, particularly in the context of televised performative actions. It is intriguing to delve into the narrative of how these artists adeptly embraced new media styles during the digital age, all the while preserving the essence of their artistic identity. Notably, Frankel's contribution transcends the bounds of her customary artistic endeavors, venturing into live-transmission performance and experimenting with technology traditionally associated with male domains in engineering and science. In her exploration of these tools, Frankel courageously challenged conventional notions of space and effectively dematerialized the inherent constraints of string, presenting a groundbreaking departure from the artistic norm. This pioneering approach, delving into live-transmission performance and utilizing technology hitherto dominated by men, marks an innovative chapter in her artistic journey. .

                Although I understand Soulellis' analysis of the performing feed and making things public, I found this reading quite hilarious. In particular, when he was describing the continuous feed of collective boredom, a state of watching-togetherness, I couldn't help laughing at the idea that our generation's attention span has dwindled down to watching live streamed intersection cameras. Boredom, as Soulellis suggests, seems to underlie much of our social media and online activities. In my view, our pervasive boredom has ushered us into a quasi-dystopian state, marked by a diminishing willingness to engage authentically. The endless feed subconsciously entraps us in a perpetual cycle of indistinct contentment, at times bordering on mind-numbing. Consider those moments when you realize you've mindlessly spent hours scrolling through TikTok. Escaping this cycle seems nearly impossible unless one consciously disengages.

                Beyond Dark Matter by Neta Bomani and Sabii Borno is a tween zine about a girl, Gem, who is stuck in a time traveling computer software called The Way. The Way explains to Gem that technology, especially software, is inherently designed to control the user. We can trace this relationship back to the master/slave relationship. Following the progression of technology, this relationship has stayed as a foundation for nearly everything. We receive or send a command and that command is followed. However, The Beyond, a space inside the software that emphasizes possibility that comes from both intuition and curiosity. It is a metaphor for our inner flame, the driving force behind our creativity and imagination.  In relation to our own society, day-by-day we rely more heavily on technologies "intuition" over our own to the point that we forget that we are the creators of their ability. However, if we learn from the wisdom Gem gathered from the Beyond, we can continue to grow and connect as a community.

            <div class="reading-content">
                The study of game theory is a subject I haven't learned about nor understood, but I was a bit lost as to how Steyerl relates it to artistic expression. The tone of her writing is inherently critical, viewing the art world's functioning as influenced by game theory. However, I disagree this is the path art is headed down. The idea that the art scene is being "gamed" through ranking scores and speculative curating practices implies that strategic elements and algorithms are shaping the art world. But how can that be true if all art is subjective, expressing ones personal perspective. Are all artistic choices more nuanced than society imagines them to be? This raises a consideration about the nature of art's relationship with social realities. Are the social scenarios in art, such as Relational Art, really abstract models mistaken for reality? The concept that Steyerl raises is interesting but incredibly hard to embrace. Steyerl's rejection of the autonomy of art and its apparent gamification seems to miss the essence of artistic expression and the diverse ways it engages with social realities.
